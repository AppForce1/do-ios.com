	            <p>Tom Lokhorst spends his time writing apps at <a href="https://www.q42.com">Q42</a>, working on apps like Rijksmuseum, PostNL and 9292. He is very excited about the new things Apple has to offer for us developers. Especially this years “sneak peek” at WWDC caught Toms attention.</p><p>In this talk we’ll take a closer look at UIKit on the Mac and explore the possibilities of a new platform opening up to us iOS developers. Afterwards you’ll have a starting point to play around with Marzipan and know how to avoid some of the pitfalls Tom experienced while trying to run some of the existing apps from Q42.</p></td>

            <p>Our speaker Bas Broek is an interesting one. Co-author of the SwiftWeekly newsletter. Developing iOS apps since 2014. You could have met him at one of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/cocoaheadsnl">CocoaHeadsNL Meetups</a>, or a try! Swift conference <a href="https://www.tryswift.co/events/2018/sanjose/">here</a> or <a href="https://www.tryswift.co/events/2018/nyc/">there</a>. </p>
	            <p>In this talk Bas will look at how documenting your APIs can help anyone interacting with it have a more pleasant time and smoother experience for every user of your framework (including your future self). All that while writing better, more maintainable code, with fewer bugs and better testability in the process.</p></td>

            <p>In the mobile department of ABN AMRO we feel the need of frequent releases to quickly react to our customers’ needs.</p>
            <p>In 2017 we started a journey to accelerate our release cycle without compromising on quality. In this talk we will focus on interesting areas that we believe are slightly less common in the industry and that are part of our ongoing journey.</p></td>

            <p><a href="https://agenda.com">Agenda</a> is Dutch, made by Alexander Griekspoor, Drew McCormack and Marcello Luppi, three former scientists with a long history of making indie apps. Alex previously made a successful app for researchers called Papers, which he eventually sold to a scientific publisher. Back in 2013 he talked about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpIonXn2U">what made him decide to give up his life as an indie developer</a> at NSConference. In this talk he picks up the story where he previously left off, telling how after a 3 year corporate stint, he felt it was time to start anew and return to something small and more hands-on creative again. How this eventually led to the idea for Agenda app and the bumpy road to his fourth Apple Design Award.</p></td>
