Accessibility seems straightforward until you start integrating it into a complex production codebase. The individual fixes may be “easy,” but adding these fixes in a way that maintains your code quality standards is where it gets tricky. In this talk, you’ll learn how to meet accessibility requirements while keeping your codebase clean, maintainable, and testable. We’ll cover tools for auditing and testing, patterns for automation, and walk through cookbook-style solutions to common accessibility problems you’re likely to face. After this talk, you’ll feel confident tackling accessibility fixes with solid, sustainable engineering.

Key Takeaways: - How to leverage existing tools and automation to save time and reduce regressions - How to structure your code so it’s clean, maintainable, and testable - Practical solutions to the most common accessibility problems in iOS development
