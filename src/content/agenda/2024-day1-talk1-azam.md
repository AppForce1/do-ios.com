summary: "What if I told you that you might be unnecessarily complicating your SwiftUI apps by selecting an architecture that doesn’t align with the declarative nature of the SwiftUI framework? Instead of battling against the framework, what if you could seamlessly work with it?"

This presentation delves into the valuable lessons I learned from my experiences constructing iOS applications with the SwiftUI framework. It sheds light on the strategic choices I made, ones that unintentionally hindered me from fully leveraging the innate capabilities of SwiftUI.

In the course of this talk, you will gain insights into the intricacies of view re-rendering in SwiftUI, master the art of segmenting environment objects, and explore the innovative method of previewing UIKit controllers within Xcode previews, among other topics of interest.

By the time you conclude this presentation, you’ll possess a refined grasp of how to impeccably arrange and design your SwiftUI applications. You will confidently embrace the embedded architecture that SwiftUI offers, enabling you to craft applications with enhanced efficiency and elegance.
