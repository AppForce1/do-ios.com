summary: "In this session we’ll dissect your .xcarchive and .ipa to show you exactly what Xcode does with your source code."
---

 We'll cover the compilation process, Mach‑O binaries, symbol tables, Info.plist, Obj-C/Swift metadata, resource catalogs, Apple signing and more. We’ll demonstrate how automated tools are used to reconstruct control flow and reveal sensitive data. Then, we show how attackers can replace or patch components inside the bundle, re‑sign it, and distribute a repackaged version. Finally, we’ll outline targeted techniques to make analysis and tampering of sensitive areas significantly harder .
