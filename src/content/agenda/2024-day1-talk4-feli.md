Explore design systems through the lens of accessibility, understand different abstraction levels, and learn best practices for API design with accessibility in mind. Experience a live demo and elevate your understanding of accessible design and its impact on creating inclusive user experiences.

Today, most apps use some form of a design system with shared UI components, allowing you to quickly create new features that fit your app’s style. Imagine if these components were accessible out of the box, freeing you from last-minute concerns when developing new features under time pressure. But what’s the right level of abstraction to build accessibility into your UI components? The more generic the component is, the more flexibly it can be used in the app, making it difficult to provide excellent accessibility support by default. How should the API be build to ensure the best possible developer and user experience? Discover the answers and see a live demo of assistive technology in action. Elevate your development skills and create apps that are effortlessly inclusive from the ground up.
