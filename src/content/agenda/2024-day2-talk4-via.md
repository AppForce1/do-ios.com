An all-inclusive, historic review with an emphasis on diverse individuals that have contributed to the growth of the development field. This discourse will cover topics from the legacy of Ada Lovelace to the origins of the Swift programming language. I share the background on the formation of the first computers, and the individuals who paved the path for the modern development field we know today.
