In this hands-on workshop, you’ll build real IoT-style applications using microcontrollers and embedded Linux boards with WiFi, GPIO, and BLE capabilities — all programmed in Swift.

During this workshop you’ll use Swift to:
- Create a custom Bluetooth service to broadcast device states.
- Control your hardware device from a mobile device
- Learn basic hardware skills like controlling a LED, and observing a sensor or button

Join us and discover how far Swift can take you. Whether you’re building the next smart device or just love pushing the boundaries of what Swift can do, this workshop will get you there!

**Note:** Hardware included.
