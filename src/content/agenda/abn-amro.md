summary: "Maybe you are already aware that how people interact with your app can differ. That people prefer to interact in a way that suits them best. And that making your app accessible is important, but maybe you don’t know where to start. In that case, this session is for you."

Jeroen will share how their accessibility journey at ABN AMRO started and hopes that you can apply some of the ideas in your own organization.

- How you can handle different perceptions
- How you can shift left to integrate accessibility in your development cycle
- How you get to know what is in the guidelines
- How to prioritize the fixing of different types of issues and meet the 2025 legislation deadline.

All in an effort so that you yourself can get the subject of accessibility rolling within your company.
