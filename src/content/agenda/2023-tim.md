The landscape of Swift is changing as we edge closer to Swift 6. Vapor 5 is aiming to be released at the same time and in this talk we’ll take a tour of what things will look like in Vapor 5 and how we’re taking advantage of all the new Swift features to provide an awesome framework for server-side Swift
