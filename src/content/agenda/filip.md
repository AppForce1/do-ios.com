Discover its features, benefits, and seamless integration into SwiftUI projects. In this talk we will explore this powerful framework and revolutionize your app design.

- Up until this point, building native iOS apps solely with SwiftUI has been a challenging task due to the limitations of its navigation capabilities. Consequently, many developers have resorted to utilizing UIKit for their navigation needs. However, with the introduction of the NavigationStack, a revolutionary framework designed specifically for SwiftUI, this limitation is no longer a barrier.
- Filip has firsthand experience with the struggles of SwiftUI navigation. He is currently working on a banking app that was initiated when SwiftUI was first introduced. Due to the limitations of SwiftUI’s navigation, the app’s navigation infrastructure was based on UIKit, resulting in an inconsistency in the tech stack.
- In this talk, he aims to explore the possibilities unlocked by the NavigationStack. By leveraging this powerful framework, developers can create seamless navigation flows within SwiftUI applications. He will delve into the various features and functionalities offered by the NavigationStack, demonstrating how it can serve as a worthy companion in overcoming the navigation challenges faced by SwiftUI developers.

Key Points to be covered:

- Overview of the challenges faced in native iOS app development using SwiftUI’s native navigation capabilities.
- The adoption of UIKit for navigation needs in SwiftUI apps
- Introduction to the NavigationStack: a powerful framework designed to enhance SwiftUI navigation.
- Deep dive into the features and functionalities of the NavigationStack.
- Demonstrations of practical implementation examples highlighting the benefits and advantages it brings to SwiftUI navigation.

- Best practices and tips for integrating the NavigationStack seamlessly into SwiftUI projects.
