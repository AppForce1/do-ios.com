summary: "Who says you need to open an app to use it? With App Intents, I tracked walks with my puppy üê∂ without taking out my iPhone. Learn how to extend your app beyond the UI using Siri, Shortcuts, Spotlight, and widgets‚Äîhands-free, in pure Swift."

This talk is about an app that (almost) does nothing on screen, but everything through the system. It logs dog walks without ever opening the app, thanks to App Intents. Actions can be triggered via Siri, automations in Shortcuts, Spotlight, or widgets.

I‚Äôll start by sharing the motivation behind the app: I wanted to log walks with my puppy without ever pulling out my iPhone, to stay focused and present. From there, I‚Äôll walk you through how I built a fully working, background-driven experience using App Intents: - How to define and register AppIntent - How to expose your app‚Äôs actions to Siri, Shortcuts, and widgets - How to pass parameters using AppEnum and AppEntity

The goal is to show how a simple Swift-based integration can unlock powerful, system-level features, without needing to touch your UI.

This talk is hands-on, pragmatic, and filled with examples you can apply in your own app. All the good stuff: Siri, Shortcuts, Widgets‚Ä¶ and fully dog-approved üêæ
