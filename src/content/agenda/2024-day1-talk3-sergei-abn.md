Explore real-world strategies from startups to enterprise-level projects like ABN Amro's personal banking app, discover how modularization improves scalability, build times, and team collaboration. Whether you're working with Swift or dealing with legacy code, this presentation will equip you with practical insights on modularizing iOS apps effectively, overcoming common challenges, and optimizing your development process.

Here are some key highlights:

- Real-world Modularization Insights: from startups to large-scale enterprise systems.
- Boost Developer Productivity: Discover how modularization can reduce build times, minimize merge conflicts, and streamline teamwork.
- Architectural Refactoring: Understand how modularization offers a second chance to reassess and improve your app’s architecture.
- Improving Code Ownership & Observability: See how breaking down monolithic apps can clarify team responsibilities and enhance code management.
- Challenges & Solutions: Address common pitfalls like handling dependencies, managing transitive relationships, and preventing bloated binaries.
- Real-World Example: A behind-the-scenes look at how ABN Amro transformed its decade-old monolithic app into a modular architecture.
- Tools & Techniques: Explore alternative build systems such as Xcodegen, Swift Package Manager, Bazel, and Tuist for optimizing your modularization efforts.
