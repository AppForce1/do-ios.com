In this session you’ll learn everything you need to know about passkeys. We’ll cover the history of passwords and two-factor authentication and why they don’t always work. We’ll see why Passkeys offer a better solution to modern day authentication and why you should offer them to your users.

We’ll go into depth about how passkeys works and then see how you can integrate them in your apps. You’ll see what you need to do to provide a seamless user experience in your apps. We’ll also see what you need to do in the backend to support passkeys and what solutions are out there to make it easy for you to ship.
