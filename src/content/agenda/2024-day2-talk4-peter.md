Learn how to use vector embeddings and an LLM to implement a knowledge base that you can hook up to Siri to get relevant answers based on data that is relevant to you!

In our fast paced world, there is just too much information, and it often seems impossible to keep up with everything that’s going on.

If you ever felt that you couldn’t possibly remember everything you saw, read, or even didn’t read, come to this talk and I will show you how I build an app that allows me to do just that.

I will show you how I

- used SwiftUI to build a beautiful app that works across Apple’s platforms
- used Cloud Firestore to store gigabytes of data, keeping it in sync across all of my devices
- used Gemini, Google’s LLM, to summarise articles, and ask my app questions about articles
- used Genkit - an AI integration framework - to connect Gemini to my personal data store
- used Siri to provide a natural language interface that allows me to query my knowledge base hands-free
