Right outside the Auditorium, in the NEMO Science Museum.

Today there won't be ING developers available during the drinks. But the ING does want to make sure you are well taken care of.

If you are taking part in the conference days, drop by during the drinks on the first conference day and meet the key developers behind the Netherlands' biggest financial app, the ING Mobile Banking App!

Always wanted to know what it's like to work on an financial app used by millions of people, to work with more than 50 highly skilled iOS engineers on an app used in multiple countries? Send an email to [sjoerd.van.oostenbrugge@ing.com](mailto:sjoerd.van.oostenbrugge@ing.com) and we might speak soon!
