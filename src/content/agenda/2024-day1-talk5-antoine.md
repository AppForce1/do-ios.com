## Antoine van der Lee

Antoine is passionate about contributing to the iOS community, where you might know him from his weekly blog posts on his personal blog called SwiftLee, his newsletter SwiftLee Weekly, SwiftLee Jobs, or RocketSim; a Simulator Enhancing App. He particularly enjoys speaking on best practices for structuring code architecture in a way that creates sustainability, as well as new Swift features and how iOS developers can be more successful in their work.

Before going Indie in 2024, he lead the team at WeTransfer as a Staff iOS Engineer and developed several large-scale apps since 2009 (iOS 4!). His most recent work resulted in a brand new course: From Side Project to Going Indie at [going-indie.com](https://going-indie.com).
