summary: "The DeviceCheck Framework has been around since iOS11 but nobody has ever really heard about it. At least not me… I stumbled opon this when playing around with some new Firebase Service. They enforce their own version of this called AppCheck for some services by now. So I wanted to find out how it works and dug deeper."

In this talk I will take a look at the two services the framework provides: DeviceIdentification and AppAttestation. I will show client and server implementation for iOS and Vapor and show how to make your network communication more secure.

It’s not a silver bullet, but an alternative or addition to certificate pinning and another tool in our iOS Dev Toolbelt.

I started out writing my diploma thesis on a multitouch finger detection library—then the iPhone arrived and changed everything. Fast forward 18 years, I turned my hobby into a job and work as an iOS developer at MaibornWolff, building apps for clients like BMW, Rolls-Royce and Deutsche Post. I used to spent my spare time with my camera roaming through nature or playing the bass in rock cover band. But in recent years my 3 kids keep me busy.
