## Antoine van der Lee

Antoine is passionate about contributing to the Swift community. You might know him from his weekly blog posts on his personal blog, SwiftLee, his newsletter, SwiftLee Weekly, or RocketSim, an Xcode Simulator-Enhancing App. He particularly enjoys speaking on best practices for structuring code architecture in a way that creates sustainability, new Swift features, and how iOS developers can be more successful in their work.

Before going Indie in 2024, he led the team at WeTransfer as a Staff iOS Engineer and developed several large-scale apps since 2009 (iOS 4!). His most recent work resulted in two brand new courses: From Side Project to Going Indie at [going-indie.com](https://www.going-indie.com) and a course focused on Swift 6 and Concurrency at [www.swiftconcurrencycourse.com](www.swiftconcurrencycourse.com).
