Around the world, technology regulation has been front of mind for the past decade. As innovations in AI, health, education, enterprise, and entertainment continue, it is likely technology-focused regulation will remain a priority for decades to come. All too often, the policymakers focused on regulating technology have an eye primarily towards the largest of the large technology companies while ignoring how new and potential laws will impact developers, independent contractors, and small businesses.

The perception is often that only large companies have the resources to directly engage with policymakers on these critical issues, and it can often be daunting trying to address regulatory concerns on your own. Luckily, there are ways for you and the global developer community to engage and share your viewpoints on issues like artificial intelligence, intellectual property, and competition, just to name a few. In this session, you can expect to find your place in the complicated world of policymaking and the digital economy and learn the role you can play in educating policymakers around the world.
