Alina will begin by introducing the OAuth 2.0 framework and its flows, highlighting the importance of access tokens and the need for secure communication. Then she'll delve into the Authorization Code flow, explaining steps in detail, and highlighting the need for an authorization code and the potential vulnerabilities associated with it. The focus then shifts to the concept of custom redirect URIs for native clients and an explanation of how they can be abused by attackers. To address these vulnerabilities, Alina will introduce PKCE as an extension to the OAuth 2.0 framework and explain its role in enhancing the security of authorization code grants used in mobile and native applications.

The limitations and potential bypasses of PKCE will also be discussed using the app impersonation attack.

Overall, this talk aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of PKCE and its role in protecting native clients within the OAuth 2.0 framework, give some tips for mitigations and highlight best practices.
