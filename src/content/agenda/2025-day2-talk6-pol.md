Have you ever spent hours chasing down frustrating performance issues like bloated app storage or laggy UIs? Or maybe you've noticed something off in your app's performance but weren't quite sure how to track down the root cause?

You're not alone. After years of debugging apps at scale, I've built a toolkit of techniques, tools, and processes to help you quickly identify and fix those elusive performance problems like a pro.

In this session, I'll take you on a deep dive into analyzing real-world performance, memory, and UI issues using Xcode's Instruments. Drawing from my own experience working with apps at scale, I'll walk you through the most common challenges developers face—from unexpected memory spikes to sluggish UI elements. You'll see how to approach these problems in practice, using real scenarios I've encountered in production apps.

We'll explore several powerful Instruments templates, including Time Profiler for spotting CPU bottlenecks and analyzing thread usage, Zombies for catching memory leaks, and the Concurrency instrument for visualizing task execution and actor behavior. I'll also highlight the often-overlooked SwiftUI instrument—a potential game-changer for anyone working with SwiftUI, especially in Xcode 26.

By the end of this session, you'll walk away with a clear process and a practical toolkit for investigating and resolving a wide range of app performance issues—ready to put to work in your own projects.
