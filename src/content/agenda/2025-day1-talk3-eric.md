type: "Talk"
summary: "In a previous role as the tech lead of a team building a digital identity solution, Eric often saw developers using cryptography without fully grasping it."

Whether during hiring, onboarding, or working with partners, Eric noticed a general lack of understanding about how the pieces fit together and why they work the way they do under the hood..

This talk aims to demystify the core concepts of cryptography (hashing, encryption, and digital signatures) in a way that’s both accessible and directly useful. We won’t dive into algorithmic details or math-heavy theory. Instead, Eric will give you the conceptual tools to understand what’s happening, why it matters, and how to use it responsibly in your apps.

With those foundations, Eric will walk through practical examples relevant to Swift and iOS development.

This talk is aimed at any developer with a basic understanding of Swift. No prior knowledge of security or cryptography is required.
Attendees will gain a practical understanding of core cryptographic concepts and how they apply to everyday development tasks, helping them build more secure, privacy-conscious apps.
