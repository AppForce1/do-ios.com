summary: "So you want to make your app accessible? Do you have an idea where to start? What your low hanging fruit is? Why don’t I just take a look at your app and tell you — and make meaningful improvements that give you an idea how important it is to get this right? Then show it at work and off you go."

Having been in the accessibility field for a number of years now, it’s great to see what seems like an improved appreciation and interest in the topic, not just because of legal requirements like the European Accessibility Act.

Yet, where do you start with this topic if you don’t know what you don’t know?

There’s still a gap when it comes to education on accessibility.

So let me show you where your app falls short, how to fix things (spoiler: it’s often straightforward), and how and why users of various assistive technologies rely on you to make your app accessible.

Then go show off the improvements and their impact at work and you’re off to the races.
