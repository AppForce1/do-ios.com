summary: "When Apple introduced iOS 18 the most prominent feature was: Apple Intelligence."

The new iPhones are build from the ground up for: Apple Intelligence.

We have finally entered the era where Apple finally let's us have a piece of the ever-exciting cake that is artificial intelligence!

It is incredibly exciting and also not available, yet. And in Europe, we have to wait even longer (thank you, privacy, duh!). So, instead of waiting patiently while things are being sorted out, why not build it on our own?

There are a lot of open-source tools and AI models out there, so let's dive into them and build our own Apple Intelligence. We're diving into tools like mlx-swift, CoreML, doing on-device inference and more. All this while maintaining the privacy of the user by running everything locally. Let's build our own Apple Intelligence - with SwiftUI and fun.
