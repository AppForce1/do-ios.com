This fast moving workshop will examine the many ways we work with state in a SwiftUI app. We’ll begin with a quick look at the familiar case in which state that belongs to the View itself and look at some requirements and best practices for @State and @Binding. Next, we move the state to controllers and models and work with ObservableObjects and @Published. We briefly explore AsyncStreams and AsyncSequences before moving to the all-new Observable APIs. Finally, we see how easy it is to persist model data using the new SwiftData framework. Whether you’ve embraced CoreData in the past or avoided it up to this point, you will see the future for persistence on Apple devices in this first look at SwiftData.
