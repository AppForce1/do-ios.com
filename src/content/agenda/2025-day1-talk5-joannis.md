Most of those apps demonstrate their technology through components that don’t quite feel right on iOS. The reason for these frameworks? Code reuse, resulting in saved costs and developer time.

But what if you could achieve the same using Swift?

In this talk, we’ll cover the new Swift on Android project by the Swift Android Workgroup. You’ll learn about the advantages of Swift on Android, and how it compares to existing ecosystems. Discover the status of the project, and find out where it’s headed to next!
