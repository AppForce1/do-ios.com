summary: "Swift 6.2 introduces stricter concurrency rules—Sendable, actor isolation, and priority enforcement—all of which reshape how we write async Swift. This talk unpacks real-world pitfalls, surprising edge cases, and modern concurrency patterns that actually hold up in production."

Swift Concurrency made writing async code easier—until Swift 6.2 made it stricter. With enforced Sendable, region-based actor isolation, and tighter priority checks, it’s now easier than ever to run into unexpected compiler errors or subtle runtime bugs.

In this talk, I’ll walk through real-world examples and live Xcode demos to explore: • How Swift 6.2 enforces actor isolation and what that means for your code • When Sendable really matters—and how to conform without overcomplicating things • Common reentrancy issues with actors, and simple patterns to avoid them • Using TaskGroup, MainActor.run, and structured concurrency effectively under the new model • How to debug async hangs, race conditions, and flaky behavior in production

You’ll leave with reliable patterns, a stronger grasp of modern Swift concurrency, and the confidence to ship safe, performant async code in Swift 6.2 and beyond.

I’m a Senior iOS Developer with over 10 years of experience building production-grade Swift apps across startups and enterprise teams. My current focus is on Swift Concurrency, developer tooling, and scalable architecture.

I regularly speak at meetups like Swift Bengaluru and Swift Chennai, and enjoy sharing practical insights from real-world projects—whether it’s debugging tricky async/await issues, implementing structured concurrency, or integrating AI tools into the iOS workflow.
