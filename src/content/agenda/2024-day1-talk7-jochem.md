A good work-life balance, being in shape, performing at work, feeling fit and well-rested, paying more attention to the kids, relaxing more easily. It’s what we all want, but in the hustle and bustle of everyday life, we often fall short. After his career as a speed skater, Jochem Uytdehaage was also confronted with the fact that he could not concentrate on five or six things at the same time, that he was too easily distracted to really perform well. He analysed his experien- ces both during and after his sporting career and discovered what he calls the ‘Batteries of Energy’.

The spiritual battery is about spirit, drive and purpose; the mental battery is about knowledge, skill and experience. The emotional battery focuses on relation- ships and emotions, and the physical battery is about nutrition, sleep, exercise and relaxation. These four batteries act like communicating vessels and have a major impact on our daily lives. Based on these batteries, Uytdehaage has developed insights and tips & tricks that he will share during his talk.
