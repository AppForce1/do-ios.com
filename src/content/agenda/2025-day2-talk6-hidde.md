AI is everywhere these days and 90% of the time it's represented by a sparkles icon.

During this session, I’ll explain why it’s sometimes best not to reveal the use of AI and offer examples of when it’s necessary to do so. I’ll also provide guidance on how to make longer loading times feel magical. The focus will be on designing AI features to ensure your app maintains its uniqueness. I will share real examples and key takeaways to remember when building your next AI-based feature.
