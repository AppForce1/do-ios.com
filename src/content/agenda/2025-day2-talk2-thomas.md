Building views on Apple platforms has never been easier thanks to SwiftUI. But building reusable components that are both flexible and easy to use remains a big challenge.

In this talk, we’ll explore a range of techniques for crafting powerful components, that pack in rich features while staying highly customizable — both in terms of design and developer ergonomics at the call site.

We’ll dive deep into strategies for data and event handling, including:

- @Binding for dynamic state sharing
- Callbacks for event communication
- View Modifiers for configuration
- Protocol for customization

Whether you’re working on a design system or crafting open-source components, this session will give you the tools to create incredible, capable, and developer-friendly components — the SwiftUI way.

## Thomas Durand

II like to go by the name of Dean, because it’s way easier to pronounce in any language, including English than “Thomas Durand”

Backend architect and security engineer by day, I’m also an iOS Indie Dev by night! On my free time, I’m building in public independent iOS app like SharePal and Padlok. I also share my discoveries while building on my blog, mostly about Swift, SwiftUI and software security.

After talking at various events, I’d like to continue growing in the community, sharing everything I learn along my journey of building indie apps, or reliable and scalable back-ends.
