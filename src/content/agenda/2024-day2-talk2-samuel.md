Instruments is a tricky app to use and the documentation isn’t super clear, but with 30 minutes worth of examples on the latest Instruments, you’ll be well on your way to making your apps launch quick like rising housing prices and run smooth like the jazz music when you’re on hold on the phone.

Apple provides Instruments, an app to find out why your app is being slow so you can fix it, but are you comfortable with it? I’ll go over some examples to show how to use the tool and help make everyone a bit more familiar with it. Let’s all have faster apps!
