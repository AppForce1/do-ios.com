Have you ever wished you could apply your Swift and iOS development skills to the world of embedded systems? Now you can, with Embedded Swift on microcontrollers. In this talk, we'll introduce you to Embedded Swift, an exciting development that allows you to write Swift code for ESP32 devices.

We'll explore how Swift can be a compelling alternative to compiled languages like C or Rust, and to interpreted languages like MicroPython or Lua, especially given its seamless integration with C. This compatibility enables you to reuse mature libraries and codebases, and integrate new technologies like the Matter protocol.

Focusing on practical aspects, we'll discuss the current support for RISC-V based ESP32 chips such as the ESP32-C family and the powerful ESP32-P4. We'll also touch on considerations for older ESP32 models and the ongoing efforts to support them.

By the end of this session, you'll know how to get started with Embedded Swift on ESP32 microcontrollers, opening up new possibilities for your Swift skills in embedded development.
