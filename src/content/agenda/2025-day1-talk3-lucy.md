As SwiftUI becomes more widely adopted, it’s easy to think that UIKit is slowly becoming a thing of the past. But is it? I’ve noticed that even when we’re not directly working with UIKit, its influence lingers in our approach to building views. It is the mindset that proves the most difficult to change. Over the past few months, I’ve been tracking SwiftUI anti-patterns that seem to originate from UIKit. Now, I want to share what I found with you to help you avoid them. I don’t want to argue in favour oft clean SwiftUI for the sake of purity. This talk is about embracing the framework fully and working with it, rather then against it. It’s about adopting the right patterns to achieve first-class accessibility, smooth animations, and optimal performance.
