But is SwiftData entirely new, or an old wolf in sheep’s clothing? Is it the yin to SwiftUI’s yang, or is NSManagedObject hiding in the shadows ready to pounce? To answer these questions and more, I’m going to take a deep dive into the data — the SwiftData. What are those shiny new macros hiding, what’s still missing in the inaugural release, and how useful is what is already there? Join me to find out why you should be using SwiftData in your next project, and why you should reconsider.
