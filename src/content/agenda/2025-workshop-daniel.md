This is a big year for App Intents. 

Apple has been laying the foundation for years. Last year they really pushed it as a way of connecting to Apple Intelligence and this year they've gone back and really smoothed out a lot of the APIs and increased the power. 

This hands-on workshop is for people who are new to App Intents. We build an example from the ground up and use it introduce all aspects of Intents and provide examples of using them in Shortcuts, Siri, Spotlight, and more.
 
**Required tools**: Mac with Xcode 16.0 or greater
