Have you ever wondered what makes SwiftUI slow?

In this workshop you’ll learn how to solve common problems in SwiftUI apps. We’ll talk about how SwiftUI looks at and compares your views to determine whether they should be redrawn, how we can use Instruments to gain insights into what your app is doing, and how we can optimize our views and models to lean into SwiftUI’s strengths.

We’ll analyse a sample app that has several issues that you might have in your own apps. Some will be obvious, others are more hidden. Together, we’ll go through the app and we’ll figure what we should do to improve the app’s performance.

By the end of this workshop you will have a much better understanding of how SwiftUI works, and you’ll be able to architect code that leans into SwiftUI’s strengths.
